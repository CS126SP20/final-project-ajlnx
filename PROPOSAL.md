# [Falling Balls]

## Project Introduction
---
For the final project I ended up creating a small game called Falling Balls. The objective of the game is
to survive as long as you can while balls fall from the top of the screen to try and crush you. The player controls a 
small rectangle using the 'A' and 'D' keys or LEFT and RIGHT to move the player to avoid the balls. A two player
option allows for a second player to use the mouse to click and spawn balls to try to kill the player controlling
the block.

## Background Info and Motivations
---
I remember playing a game like this when I was younger, and I always thought it was fun. I was motivated to switch to
this project from my original idea because I still wanted to use a physics library as the basis of my application when the
Kinect library wasn't working. 

## External Libraries
---
For this project I utilized the following libraries:
[Box2D](https://box2d.org/), 
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), 
[ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

## Timeline
---
**Week 1:** Setup IDE and experiment with Box2D 
**Week 2:** Use graphics library to render the box2d world and complete most gameplay logic.  
**Week 3:** Add menus with ImGui and finalize game.  

In the event that I am able to complete the project early, I would add different gameplay options and extra menu options.
